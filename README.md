# Hotel Management System

This project is a **Hotel Management System** developed as part of my internship. It focuses on front-end development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, providing a dynamic platform for hotel operations. The system has distinct interfaces for **customers**, **operators**, and **administrators**, each catering to different roles and permissions.

## üåü Overview

The system is designed with three primary interfaces:
1. **Customer Interface**: Guests can browse available rooms, check pricing, and make bookings.
2. **Operator Interface**: Operators manage room availability and bookings but do not have access to financial data like profit and loss.
3. **Admin Interface**: Administrators have full access, including managing bookings and viewing profit/loss details for the hotel.

The application is responsive, making it easy to use across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Room Booking System**:
   - Customers can view rooms, select check-in/check-out dates, and book rooms.
   - Room availability is updated dynamically through **JavaScript** and **DOM manipulation** for real-time feedback.

2. **Operator Dashboard**:
   - Operators manage bookings and room availability but cannot access financial details such as profit and loss.
   - Real-time updates allow smooth management of daily operations.

3. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Admins have access to full management capabilities, including viewing profit and loss, managing room availability, and overseeing all bookings.
   - Provides a complete view of hotel performance, unlike the operator's restricted view.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Fully responsive layout ensures smooth usage on any device, from desktop to mobile.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the web pages and creates forms for input.
- **CSS**: Styles the pages using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for responsiveness and layout control.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, validates form inputs, and updates the user interface in real-time.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Used to dynamically update room availability and handle user interactions.
